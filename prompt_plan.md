# Code-Generation LLM Prompts

Below are example prompt templates for guiding a code-generation LLM step-by-step. Each is in a separate markdown fenced code block with `text` tag for clarity.

---

```text
// Prompt 1: Backend Setup - Spring Boot Project Initialization
You are to generate a Spring Boot project with Maven including dependencies for spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, liquibase-core, postgresql driver, and spring-boot-starter-security. Configure the application.properties with PostgreSQL connection details (host, port, dbname, username, password). Create a simple REST controller with endpoint `/api/ping` returning "pong" for health check.
```

---

```text
// Prompt 2: Database Schema Setup - Liquibase changelogs for User table
Generate Liquibase changelog XML file to create a `users` table with columns: UUID (primary key, UUID), username (unique, varchar), password_hash (varchar), role (varchar), active (boolean). Ensure proper constraints and indices. Provide changelog file content.
```

---

```text
// Prompt 3: Backend - User Entity and Repository
Create a JPA entity class User with fields: UUID id, String username, String passwordHash, String role, boolean active. Annotate appropriately. Create a Spring Data JPA repository interface UserRepository with common methods.
```

---

```text
// Prompt 4: Frontend Setup - React with TypeScript, Redux, and MUI baseline
Initialize React app with TypeScript. Setup Redux store with empty slices for user and records. Setup routing with react-router-dom for login, officer dashboard, and admin dashboard pages. Setup Material UI theme provider and basic styling.

Implement user management CRUD UI for admins. Backend endpoints to create, edit, deactivate users, reset passwords, and assign roles. Ensure role-based access control.
```

---

```text
// Prompt 16: Audit Logging - Backend and Frontend Viewer
Ensure all actions create audit logs with user UUID, timestamp, action type, record number, before and after JSON states. Implement backend query API and frontend audit log viewer page for admins, showing logs chronologically.
```

---

```text

# Summary

* The blueprint covers all functional and non-functional requirements.
* Iterative chunks split the work into manageable parts.
* Small steps within chunks are sized for safe implementation with testing.
* Code-generation prompts reflect each step, progressively building the system.
* Each prompt builds on the previous, ensuring integrated, no orphaned code.
