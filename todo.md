  - Loading and error states handling

---

## 5. Enforcement Actions

  - Payment Receipts
  - Warrant Execution Confirmations
  - Include all headers, body fields, and footers as specified

- [ ] Server-side validation and error handling

- [ ] Global backend error handling middleware to catch and log errors

- [ ] User-friendly error messages on frontend

---

## 10. Testing Plan

- [ ] Unit tests:
  - Backend services, controllers, repositories
  - Frontend components, Redux actions and reducers

- [ ] Integration tests:
  - End-to-end workflow: entry → lookup → action → PDF → XML export

- [ ] Security tests:
  - Role-based access enforcement
  - Input sanitization and OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities

- [ ] Performance tests:
  - Simulate concurrent users and actions

---

## 11. Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Prepare Liquibase migration scripts for production

- [ ] Setup PostgreSQL with secure access and backups

- [ ] Prepare backend deployment scripts and configuration

- [ ] Prepare frontend build and deployment process (static server or CDN)

- [ ] Document deployment steps and environment setup

# Optional / Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)

- Implement session timeouts and 2FA

- Add offline support and data synchronization

- Add audit log filtering and search capabilities

- Improve UI/UX with enhanced accessibility

---

# Notes

- Each task should include proper code comments and documentation.

- Follow best practices for security, data handling, and error logging.

- Maintain consistent coding standards between frontend and backend.
